We are given an array and a set of query ranges, we are required to find the sum of every query range.

Input:  arr[]   = {1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 8};
        query[] = [0, 4], [1, 3] [2, 4]
Output: Sum of arr[] elements in range [0, 4] is 8
        Sum of arr[] elements in range [1, 3] is 4  
        Sum of arr[] elements in range [2, 4] is 6
        
        
        
        
        
Solution:
  A Naive Solution is to run a loop from L to R and calculate the sum of elements in given range for every query [L, R]
  
  // C++ Program to compute sum of ranges for different range
// queries.
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// Structure to represent a query range
struct Query
{
	int L, R;
};

// Prints sum of all query ranges. m is number of queries
// n is the size of the array.
void printQuerySums(int a[], int n, Query q[], int m)
{
	// One by one compute sum of all queries
	for (int i=0; i<m; i++)
	{
		// Left and right boundaries of current range
		int L = q[i].L, R = q[i].R;

		// Compute sum of current query range
		int sum = 0;
		for (int j=L; j<=R; j++)
			sum += a[j];

		// Print sum of current query range
		cout << "Sum of [" << L << ", "
			<< R << "] is " << sum << endl;
	}
}

// Driver program
int main()
{
	int a[] = {1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2, 8};
	int n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);
	Query q[] = {{0, 4}, {1, 3}, {2, 4}};
	int m = sizeof(q)/sizeof(q[0]);
	printQuerySums(a, n, q, m);
	return 0;
}


Output: 

Sum of [0, 4] is 8
Sum of [1, 3] is 4
Sum of [2, 4] is 6
